    <p>This home page will explain about what the campsite
        offers for its campers. The purpose of this website is 
        to allow campers to enjoy luxury camping on tropical beaches.
        My goal is to also advertise as much acommodation for campers
        with physical and visual diasbilities. This website will also
    have saftey wavers that campers sign to ride the water vehicles
,such as the jet ski. Lastly, this website will advertise the health 
benefits of camping, such as peace and quiet, more execise, and reduced stress.</p>
